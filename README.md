# FPGA_Erosion_Dilation_Filters_using_HLS
The goal of this project was to implement and test basic morphological image processing operations — erosion, dilation, and edge detection — using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). These operations are essential in many image processing tasks, especially where shape and structure need to be enhanced or analyzed.
